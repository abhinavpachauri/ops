## 25 POPCAP/ELECTRONIC ARTS

##### HEAD OFFICE: Seattle, US (Popcap HQ)
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Lucky Gem Casino
##### MAU FOR JULY: 202,725

Our ﬁrst entry is the EA-backed PopCap Games, whose only signiﬁcant social casino brand is the still popular Lucky Gem Casino. Lucky Gem was one of the biggest fallers in MAU in the past 12 months according to metricsmonk in July’s SCi and the lack of alternative products and EA’s sale of its WSOP.com game to CIE doesn’t suggest a ﬁrm truly focused on social casino. Nonetheless, you can’t ignore the scale of EA, and it still has the potential to compete.

## 24 SGN

##### HEAD OFFICE: Beverly Hills, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Blingo Bingo
##### MAU FOR JULY: 962,557

The Los Angeles-based casual games ﬁrm only has one social casino product, but it is a top 20 performer and is available on a number of mobile platforms including iOS, Android and Kindle. Funded by Austin Ventures, and led by a seasoned team of internet pioneers including the co-founder and former CEO of MySpace, it’s a ﬁrm with serious ambitions in social and its proprietary platform allows new games to be quickly spun out onto mobile. One to keep an eye on.

## 23 GAMING REALMS/BEJIG

##### HEAD OFFICE: London, England
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Avatingo
##### MAU: N/A

While its ﬂagship Avatingo offering attracts fewer MAU than many of the others in this list, London-based ﬁrm BeJig is far more creative than some competitors. It became the ﬁrst in the space to launch a Facebook version of multiplayer card game Sh*tHead and also rolled out Five Star Slots in recent months. The company will be able to increase its scope having been incorporated into Gaming Realms, a new ﬁrm which recently announced plans to list on the London Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM).

## 22 888/MYTOPIA

##### HEAD OFFICE: Gibraltar
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Bingo Island, Bingo Appy
##### MAU FOR JULY: 154,900

It would be hard to justify a place in the Power 25 for 888 based on its social casino performance alone. The MAU from its Bingo Island app are not in the same league as some others on this list, and the lack of a mobile presence is another mark against it. But as one of the few operators with a real-money app (Bingo Appy) on Facebook, it can’t be ignored in any list of the power operators. Like many of the real-money online ﬁrms, it appears to be moving slowly in this space, but it still has a lot of potential.

## 21 BOYAA

##### HEAD OFFICE: Shenzhen, China
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Poker Texas Hold’em
##### MAU FOR JULY: 558,950

Boyaa has a huge presence in South East Asia, with massive MAU on Facebook in Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. It is also huge in China, although it’s less clear how well the ﬁrm monetises its social poker game. Eilers Research has Boyaa as its 10th largest social casino operator by revenue in Q2 2013 with $6.3m, including $2m from mobile. It has a strong mobile presence with its poker game available on iOS, but its lack of other products sees it marked down.

## 20 MGM/PLAYSTUDIOS

##### HEAD OFFICE: Burlingame, US (PlaystudiosHQ)
##### KEY PRODUCTS: myVEGAS Slots
##### MAU FOR JULY: 417,895

The myVEGAS app produced in association with the MGM Casino group in the US has been a huge success for both parties since its launch in summer 2012. The app has peaked at over 1m MAU and is 28th in Dystillr’s charts for July 2013. Its unique model allows players to earn rewards at MGM properties, as well as employing standard monetisation techniques. Playstudios has continued to add games to the product during 2013 and a mobile launch is set for September.

## 19 PACIFIC INTERACTIVE

##### HEAD OFFICE: Victoria, Australia
##### KEY PRODUCTS: House of Fun
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,158,424

With well over 1m MAU, Paciﬁc Interactive is one of the biggest providers of social slots games around and continues to monetise well. It currently has 24 games available on its House of Fun app, which is available on Facebook and iOS devices, with additional plans to launch on Android. Although remaining in our top 20, a lack of product diversity holds it back from a higher position.

## 18 ARISTOCRAT/PRODUCT MADNESS

##### HEAD OFFICE: San Francisco, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Hollywood Spins, 3D Slots, Heart of Vegas, Bingo Madness
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,001,854

The San Francisco-based studio is one of the bigger fallers in this year’s list, primarily because it’s failed to show much innovation in product and mobile. Since its acquisition by Australian land-based slots ﬁrm Aristocrat, there have been no major new launches, although it’s retained a solid ranking on our Dystillr charts. With its most popular Facebook games yet to appear on mobile, it places them in a difﬁcult position with so much of the growth in the next 12 months expected to be outside of Facebook. Nonetheless, it is still well positioned and, as part of Aristocrat’s wider online platform, it is likely to perform far better in the next 12 months.

## 17 HIGH 5 GAMES

##### HEAD OFFICE: New York, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: High 5 Casino
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,113,218

Largely ranked low due to the relative infancy of its consumer-facing social casino business and its lack of mobile presence, High 5 has shown huge growth in the past
12 months and reached 1m MAU within four months of launching its High 5 Casino app on Facebook last September. It ranks at 15th on the Dystillr July list and 27th in MetricsMonk social gambling rankings. Work still needs to be done on expanding its product range and its mobile presence, though progress is expected to accelerate following the acquisition of the assets and IP of social games developer Electrotank in June.

## 16 PLUMBEE

##### HEAD OFFICE: London, UK
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Mirrorball Slots
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,069,726

Founded in 2012, Plumbee has grown slowly but surely thanks to a well differentiated offering, and Mirrorball Slots is currently the 17th largest game in terms of MAU on Dystillr’s rankings. It’s also one of the new operators in real-money, through its co-owned Bonza venture. At the time of writing Plumbee had just launched its ﬁrst slots game developed by a newly created in-house development team, adding to its content already provided by its strategic partner Quickspin. In addition, it recently announced the release of Mirrorball Slots on iOS, its ﬁrst foray into the mobile world. And the slots-focused ﬁrm shows signs of growing even further.

## 15 AKAMON

##### HEAD OFFICE: Barcelona, Spain
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Mundijuegos Bingo, Mundijeux Bingo
##### MAU FOR JULY: N/A

Winner of Rising Star and Social Bingo Product prizes at the 2012 eGaming Review Operator Awards, Akamon hit the landmark of 10m registered users across its Facebook app, gaming platforms and partner portals this year. The company maintains its focus in Southern Europe and Latin America and launched its ﬁrst mobile title, Bingo Rider, on 1 May. With ﬁve new mobile app launches by the end of the year and plans to become a mobile-ﬁrst company, Akamon could well see itself climb up the Power 25 rankings next year.

## 14 KAMA GAMES

##### HEAD OFFICE: Dublin, Ireland
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Pokerist, Roulettist
##### MAU FOR JULY: N/A

Headquartered in Dublin, this mobile-focused operator remains wide-ranging within its preferred channel, with Android, iPhone and iPad-speciﬁc versions of its poker and roulette games helping it reportedly attain more than one million daily active users and develop a presence in multiple countries. Its biggest app is Pokerist, which commands strong revenues on mobile although has a smaller presence on Facebook. Earlier this year, it announced the establishment of a publishing division, agreeing its ﬁrst partnership in H1, which shows the ambition of the ﬁrm.

## 13 DIWIP

##### HEAD OFFICE: Tel Aviv, Israel
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Best Casino
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,072,677

The Best Casino operator lost a key member of staff in May when chief executive Dan Wiegenfeld was poached by Playtech to head up the London-listed solutions provider’s social gaming operation. It remains to be seen whether founders Yaniv Gamzo and Udi Kantzuker can keep the momentum following his departure, but the operator’s Best Casino offering remains 16th in the Dystillr rankings and is believed to monetise well. The Israeli-founded ﬁrm remains ambitious, with Kantzuker pledging to “set the bar higher for slot machines and online gaming”. Diwip launched its new offering, Slots Club, in June, and is keen to increase its scope in mobile following an Android-speciﬁc push for Best Casino last August.

## 12 DRAGONPLAY

##### HEAD OFFICE: Tel Aviv, Israel
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Dragonplay Poker, Slot City Casino
##### MAU FOR JULY: 938,954

Primarily a smartphone social developer, with a product range including poker, blackjack, slots and bingo, the Israeli ﬁrm has made decent strides into Facebook, with its Dragonplay Poker having an estimated 545,000 MAU in July according to Dystillr, and its Slot City casino still performing well. Eilers Research estimated its Q2 revenue on Facebook at $4m and it remains a powerful operator on mobile platforms. The operator’s heavy reliance on Android, highlighted in last year’s Power 25, has been mitigated slightly with the three largest of its six social casino games available on iOS and Facebook.

## 11 BLUE SHELL GAMES

##### HEAD OFFICE: San Francisco, California
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Lucky Slots
##### MAU FOR JULY: 2,536,508

Despite a relatively modest product suite, Blue Shell Games makes it into the Power 25 based largely on the sheer strength of its player volume ﬁgures. The company, heavily reliant on its ﬂagship game Lucky Slots, ranks as the ﬁfth largest social casino gaming publisher on Facebook in Eilers Research’s latest report, with more than 3.5m monthly active users and quarterly revenue of $10.5m. This is even more remarkable given the team is only about 20 strong. Speaking with SCi earlier in the year, CEO Brian Leung outlined plans for an Android version of Lucky Slots to complement its iOS app.
