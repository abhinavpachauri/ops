## 25 POPCAP/ELECTRONIC ARTS

##### HEAD OFFICE: Seattle, US (Popcap HQ)
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Lucky Gem Casino
##### MAU FOR JULY: 202,725

Our ﬁrst entry is the EA-backed PopCap Games, whose only signiﬁcant social casino brand is the still popular Lucky Gem Casino. Lucky Gem was one of the biggest fallers in MAU in the past 12 months according to metricsmonk in July’s SCi and the lack of alternative products and EA’s sale of its WSOP.com game to CIE doesn’t suggest a ﬁrm truly focused on social casino. Nonetheless, you can’t ignore the scale of EA, and it still has the potential to compete.

## 24 SGN

##### HEAD OFFICE: Beverly Hills, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Blingo Bingo
##### MAU FOR JULY: 962,557

The Los Angeles-based casual games ﬁrm only has one social casino product, but it is a top 20 performer and is available on a number of mobile platforms including iOS, Android and Kindle. Funded by Austin Ventures, and led by a seasoned team of internet pioneers including the co-founder and former CEO of MySpace, it’s a ﬁrm with serious ambitions in social and its proprietary platform allows new games to be quickly spun out onto mobile. One to keep an eye on.

## 23 GAMING REALMS/BEJIG

##### HEAD OFFICE: London, England
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Avatingo
##### MAU: N/A

While its ﬂagship Avatingo offering attracts fewer MAU than many of the others in this list, London-based ﬁrm BeJig is far more creative than some competitors. It became the ﬁrst in the space to launch a Facebook version of multiplayer card game Sh*tHead and also rolled out Five Star Slots in recent months. The company will be able to increase its scope having been incorporated into Gaming Realms, a new ﬁrm which recently announced plans to list on the London Stock Exchange’s Alternative Investment Market (AIM).

## 22 888/MYTOPIA

##### HEAD OFFICE: Gibraltar
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Bingo Island, Bingo Appy
##### MAU FOR JULY: 154,900

It would be hard to justify a place in the Power 25 for 888 based on its social casino performance alone. The MAU from its Bingo Island app are not in the same league as some others on this list, and the lack of a mobile presence is another mark against it. But as one of the few operators with a real-money app (Bingo Appy) on Facebook, it can’t be ignored in any list of the power operators. Like many of the real-money online ﬁrms, it appears to be moving slowly in this space, but it still has a lot of potential.

## 21 BOYAA

##### HEAD OFFICE: Shenzhen, China
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Poker Texas Hold’em
##### MAU FOR JULY: 558,950

Boyaa has a huge presence in South East Asia, with massive MAU on Facebook in Indonesia, Korea and Vietnam. It is also huge in China, although it’s less clear how well the ﬁrm monetises its social poker game. Eilers Research has Boyaa as its 10th largest social casino operator by revenue in Q2 2013 with $6.3m, including $2m from mobile. It has a strong mobile presence with its poker game available on iOS, but its lack of other products sees it marked down.

## 20 MGM/PLAYSTUDIOS

##### HEAD OFFICE: Burlingame, US (PlaystudiosHQ)
##### KEY PRODUCTS: myVEGAS Slots
##### MAU FOR JULY: 417,895

The myVEGAS app produced in association with the MGM Casino group in the US has been a huge success for both parties since its launch in summer 2012. The app has peaked at over 1m MAU and is 28th in Dystillr’s charts for July 2013. Its unique model allows players to earn rewards at MGM properties, as well as employing standard monetisation techniques. Playstudios has continued to add games to the product during 2013 and a mobile launch is set for September.

## 19 PACIFIC INTERACTIVE

##### HEAD OFFICE: Victoria, Australia
##### KEY PRODUCTS: House of Fun
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,158,424

With well over 1m MAU, Paciﬁc Interactive is one of the biggest providers of social slots games around and continues to monetise well. It currently has 24 games available on its House of Fun app, which is available on Facebook and iOS devices, with additional plans to launch on Android. Although remaining in our top 20, a lack of product diversity holds it back from a higher position.

## 18 ARISTOCRAT/PRODUCT MADNESS

##### HEAD OFFICE: San Francisco, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Hollywood Spins, 3D Slots, Heart of Vegas, Bingo Madness
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,001,854

The San Francisco-based studio is one of the bigger fallers in this year’s list, primarily because it’s failed to show much innovation in product and mobile. Since its acquisition by Australian land-based slots ﬁrm Aristocrat, there have been no major new launches, although it’s retained a solid ranking on our Dystillr charts. With its most popular Facebook games yet to appear on mobile, it places them in a difﬁcult position with so much of the growth in the next 12 months expected to be outside of Facebook. Nonetheless, it is still well positioned and, as part of Aristocrat’s wider online platform, it is likely to perform far better in the next 12 months.

## 17 HIGH 5 GAMES

##### HEAD OFFICE: New York, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: High 5 Casino
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,113,218

Largely ranked low due to the relative infancy of its consumer-facing social casino business and its lack of mobile presence, High 5 has shown huge growth in the past
12 months and reached 1m MAU within four months of launching its High 5 Casino app on Facebook last September. It ranks at 15th on the Dystillr July list and 27th in MetricsMonk social gambling rankings. Work still needs to be done on expanding its product range and its mobile presence, though progress is expected to accelerate following the acquisition of the assets and IP of social games developer Electrotank in June.

## 16 PLUMBEE

##### HEAD OFFICE: London, UK
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Mirrorball Slots
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,069,726

Founded in 2012, Plumbee has grown slowly but surely thanks to a well differentiated offering, and Mirrorball Slots is currently the 17th largest game in terms of MAU on Dystillr’s rankings. It’s also one of the new operators in real-money, through its co-owned Bonza venture. At the time of writing Plumbee had just launched its ﬁrst slots game developed by a newly created in-house development team, adding to its content already provided by its strategic partner Quickspin. In addition, it recently announced the release of Mirrorball Slots on iOS, its ﬁrst foray into the mobile world. And the slots-focused ﬁrm shows signs of growing even further.

## 15 AKAMON

##### HEAD OFFICE: Barcelona, Spain
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Mundijuegos Bingo, Mundijeux Bingo
##### MAU FOR JULY: N/A

Winner of Rising Star and Social Bingo Product prizes at the 2012 eGaming Review Operator Awards, Akamon hit the landmark of 10m registered users across its Facebook app, gaming platforms and partner portals this year. The company maintains its focus in Southern Europe and Latin America and launched its ﬁrst mobile title, Bingo Rider, on 1 May. With ﬁve new mobile app launches by the end of the year and plans to become a mobile-ﬁrst company, Akamon could well see itself climb up the Power 25 rankings next year.

## 14 KAMA GAMES

##### HEAD OFFICE: Dublin, Ireland
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Pokerist, Roulettist
##### MAU FOR JULY: N/A

Headquartered in Dublin, this mobile-focused operator remains wide-ranging within its preferred channel, with Android, iPhone and iPad-speciﬁc versions of its poker and roulette games helping it reportedly attain more than one million daily active users and develop a presence in multiple countries. Its biggest app is Pokerist, which commands strong revenues on mobile although has a smaller presence on Facebook. Earlier this year, it announced the establishment of a publishing division, agreeing its ﬁrst partnership in H1, which shows the ambition of the ﬁrm.

## 13 DIWIP

##### HEAD OFFICE: Tel Aviv, Israel
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Best Casino
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,072,677

The Best Casino operator lost a key member of staff in May when chief executive Dan Wiegenfeld was poached by Playtech to head up the London-listed solutions provider’s social gaming operation. It remains to be seen whether founders Yaniv Gamzo and Udi Kantzuker can keep the momentum following his departure, but the operator’s Best Casino offering remains 16th in the Dystillr rankings and is believed to monetise well. The Israeli-founded ﬁrm remains ambitious, with Kantzuker pledging to “set the bar higher for slot machines and online gaming”. Diwip launched its new offering, Slots Club, in June, and is keen to increase its scope in mobile following an Android-speciﬁc push for Best Casino last August.

## 12 DRAGONPLAY

##### HEAD OFFICE: Tel Aviv, Israel
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Dragonplay Poker, Slot City Casino
##### MAU FOR JULY: 938,954

Primarily a smartphone social developer, with a product range including poker, blackjack, slots and bingo, the Israeli ﬁrm has made decent strides into Facebook, with its Dragonplay Poker having an estimated 545,000 MAU in July according to Dystillr, and its Slot City casino still performing well. Eilers Research estimated its Q2 revenue on Facebook at $4m and it remains a powerful operator on mobile platforms. The operator’s heavy reliance on Android, highlighted in last year’s Power 25, has been mitigated slightly with the three largest of its six social casino games available on iOS and Facebook.

## 11 BLUE SHELL GAMES

##### HEAD OFFICE: San Francisco, California
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Lucky Slots
##### MAU FOR JULY: 2,536,508

Despite a relatively modest product suite, Blue Shell Games makes it into the Power 25 based largely on the sheer strength of its player volume ﬁgures. The company, heavily reliant on its ﬂagship game Lucky Slots, ranks as the ﬁfth largest social casino gaming publisher on Facebook in Eilers Research’s latest report, with more than 3.5m monthly active users and quarterly revenue of $10.5m. This is even more remarkable given the team is only about 20 strong. Speaking with SCi earlier in the year, CEO Brian Leung outlined plans for an Android version of Lucky Slots to complement its iOS app.

## 10 GREENTUBE/CERVO-MEDIA

##### HEAD OFFICE: Vienna, Austria
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Pharaoh’s Way
##### MAU FOR JULY: N/A

Austrian business Cervo-Media has been a sleeper hit since its launch in January 2009, keeping a relatively low proﬁle while generating an impressive $8.5m in Q2 revenues from mobile alone, according to Eilers Research. But it is let down by a limited product offering, with Pharaoh’s Way its only social casino title. Last December saw the ﬁrm sign a strategic agreement with Greentube, becoming a subsidiary of the European egaming
solutions provider, and it should be able to beneﬁt from the increased clout that comes from an association with a strong and well-established real-money ﬁrm. If it can make that much money from one title on mobile, it could be a real threat with an expansion of product.

## 9 STORM8

##### HEAD OFFICE: Redwood City, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Shark Party Slots, Shark Party Bingo, Shark Party Poker
##### MAU FOR JULY: N/A

The California-based social gaming ﬁrm is a new entry on the Power 25 list thanks to
the huge success of its social casino subsidiary Shark Party. Storm8 was one of the ﬁrst developers on the iOS Games Centre and is a major player on Android and Kindle Fire through casual titles such as Bubble Mania, with 400m downloads to date. Its simply named Slots, Bingo and Poker apps are available on the iOS platform, with the former by far its most successful with an estimated $6.25m in revenue in Q2, according to Eilers Research. It has no presence on Facebook so can’t be considered for a higher ranking, but its phenomenal success on mobile can’t be ignored.

## 8 GAMESYS

##### HEAD OFFICE: London, UK
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Jackpotjoy Slot Machines, Bingo Friendzy
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,034,212

With a social gaming studio comprising 80 people, there is no lack of effort put into social casino from the predominately real-money operator and owner of the JackpotJoy brand.
The launch of Facebook RMG last August through its Bingo Friendzy app has arguably not had a ground-breaking impact, though credit is due for taking the plunge before any others.
JackpotJoy Slots continues to perform strongly on Facebook, consistently racking up more than 1m MAU. Gamesys has shown progress, but a lot of the results are yet to be seen. Free-to-play and real-money poker offerings are in the pipeline representing Gamesys’ ﬁrst foray into the space and it remains one to watch.

## 7 BIG FISH GAMES

##### HEAD OFFICE: Seattle, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Big Fish Casino
##### MAU FOR JULY: N/A

Big Fish is a newcomer in SCi’s Power 25 list and has broken in to the top 10 with its mobile offering gaining top marks from the panel. According to Eilers Research, Big Fish Casino is now the largest standalone social casino app on mobile/tablet, with net revenues of $14.5m and impressive 19% quarter-on-quarter growth. The operator is also one of the few social casino companies to move into the realm of real-money after launching an iOS version of its ﬂagship game in the UK with real-money slots following a partnership with Betable.

## 6 BASH GAMING (FORMERLY BITRHYMES)

##### HEAD OFFICE: Foster City, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Bingo Bash
##### MAU FOR JULY: 2,314,697

To reﬂect the company’s love of making games, BitRhymes rebranded to Bash Gaming in December and is one of the biggest mover’s in this year’s Power 25. Up from 17th position, Bash Gaming generated nearly $15m in total revenue during Q2 2013, split almost equally across Facebook and mobile. Bingo Bash is by far its biggest product offering, with more than 1.5m users per day and one of the top grossing games on iOS and Android devices. Despite leading the way in the bingo vertical, and with a multiplatform offering, the panel concluded its lack of product diversity held it back from a top ﬁve position.

## 5 GSN

##### HEAD OFFICE: Waltham, Massachusetts, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Games by GSN
##### MAU FOR JULY: 2,805,875

With a position of ﬁfth in the Dystillr July MAU rankings and sixth overall in the Eilers Research Q2 2013 revenue rankings, it’s easy to see why GSN deserves its spot based on numbers alone. When you add in the scale of its parent company, its links to some powerful brands including Wheel of Fortune, and its broad product range, you can understand why it’s risen so high in the Power 25 list this year. Games by GSN is the home for its wide range of social casino games, which generated in the region of $15m in revenue during Q2 2013, according to Eilers Research, with more than a third of that coming through the mobile channel. That said, Games by GSN has been going backwards in terms of MAU in recent months, and it needs to return to growth to become one of the bigger hitters in the sector. For now, it remains a powerful ﬁrm with more potential than it has yet realised.

## 4 WILLIAMS INTERACTIVE (WMS)

##### HEAD OFFICE: Waukegan, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Jackpot Party Casino Slots
##### MAU FOR JULY: 1,189,811

Last year, WMS’ ranking in the Power 25 was based largely on potential, and this potential has clearly been fulﬁlled. After launching in earnest in July 2012, the online arm of land-based slots giant WMS has seen its Jackpot Party social casino offering become the fastest growing app in both DAU and MAU according to metricsmonk’s ﬁgures for the year ended June 2013. Consistent across multiple channels with its $18m+ in Q2 revenues split roughly 2:1 between Facebook and mobile, it is good enough for a top ﬁve position in the former category and top 10 in the latter.
While growth on Facebook has been relatively ﬂat in revenue terms, the opposite is the story for mobile. Growth of 61% quarter-on-quarter has helped the company increase its market share to 6%, as WMS has built on the June 2012 acquisition of Phantom EFX with the rollout of multiple social casino titles, the bulk in the slots vertical. The Jackpot Party iOS version is in the top 10 highest grossing social casino apps for both iPad and iPhone.
Social casino was singled out as a key contributing factor in its parent group Williams Interactive revenues and an Android version of the ﬂagship social casino title is on the way. Following the landmark $1.5bn acquisition of its parent company by Scientiﬁc Games, Williams Interactive seems set for further growth and social casino is sure to play a major role in this. If it can come anywhere close to repeating the multi-channel real-money success of Jackpot Party, it could be pushing for a top three slot next year.

## 3 INTERNATIONAL GAME TECHNOLOGY/DOUBLEDOWN INTERACTIVE

##### HEAD OFFICE: Reno/Las Vegas, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Double Down Casino Slots & Poker
##### MAU FOR JULY: 7,013,566

The $500m headline ﬁgure attached to the January 2012 DoubleDown Interactive acquisition may have raised eyebrows at the time, but IGT has clearly been vindicated in its decision. DoubleDown Casino is the second highest ranking social casino app on Facebook, with only Zynga Poker having a higher MAU.
Bingo was added to the company’s ﬂagship casino offering in September last year, and its revenues are estimated at around $44m for Q2 2013 by Eilers Research with a 16% rise against the previous quarter.
Mobile revenues topped $10m in the second quarter, securing a top ﬁve placing for IGT in that channel, with DoubleDown seeing a phenomenal 84% rise in mobile revenues in Q2. Since then it has agreed to integrate the DoubleDown Casino app into Playphone’s mobile social casino platform, as well as rolling out a suite of 10 mobile social slots based on its land-based titles. While IGT is ranked at number three, the gap between it and Zynga and CIE is very small and it would be no surprise to see it take on the number one spot next year.

## 2 ZYNGA

##### HEAD OFFICE: San Francisco, US
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Zynga Poker, Zynga Slingo, Zynga Slots
##### MAU FOR JULY: 34,072,957

It’s been a transitional year for Zynga in more ways than one. The ﬁrm has seen its share price drop like a stone, face a large reduction in headcount with 520 employees being laid off, the launch of real-money gaming and the appointment of a new CEO. The one time golden boy of the sector has had a bit of a kicking in the media and is in desperate need of a good news story, but there is no denying the continued strength of its social casino business. Zynga Poker contributes 22% of all Zynga gaming revenues.
Zynga continues to dominate MAU on Facebook for social casino with Zynga Poker, but all is not well with its star product. As of Q1 2013, the ﬁrm can still claim to have the biggest revenue generating product in Zynga Poker, with revenues growing by 7.8% year-on-year to $50.5m. Slotomania from CIE earned $46.6m in the same period, although CIE’s total revenues were $66.6m. But Q2 could be a different story. Zynga Poker suffered an estimated 16% drop in MAU during Q2 2013, according to Eilers Research, and told investors it is suffering from third-party sales of its poker chips eating into its revenues.
Its relatively weak performance in mobile is another area of concern, with the ﬁrm admitting it needs to work on this area, with only 22% of its revenue coming through the mobile channel in Q1. And while its real-money launch in the UK was a major development, it has yet to provide any big revenues, admitting it does not know if it will succeed in converting current players or attracting new players to its real-money game. The launch of RMG on Facebook in the UK should kick-start growth in this sector and any moves into new regulated markets, particularly in the US, could see a big change in fortunes.
For now, Zynga remains one of the key power players in this sector, with huge MAU and impressive revenues. But its problems, and lack of growth in social casino, mean it drops a place in this year’s rankings.

## 1 CAESARS INTERACTIVE

##### HEAD OFFICE: Montreal, Canada
##### KEY PRODUCTS: Slotomania, Caesars Casino, Bingo Blitz
##### MAU FOR JULY: 5,923,664

Last year’s number two takes the top spot on the SCi Power 25 this time around, and with good reason. The acquisition of last year’s fourth-placed ﬁrm Buffalo Studios moved it onto a new level, but it’s not as simple as 2+4=1. With revenues of $66.6m in Q1 2013, and 49% of those from mobile, Caesars Interactive Entertainment is arguably the largest social casino operator.
While Zynga has other battles to ﬁght, CIE is heavily focused on the sector and continues to be acquisitive, snapping up the team behind its WSOP mobile app from Electronic Arts earlier this year. Its strong portfolio of games includes Caesars Casino and Bingo Blitz, as well as the WSOP mobile app, but the cash cow continues to be Slotomania.
Facebook revenues have been ﬂat during the past six months, but there has been strong growth in mobile, and combined with its powerful revenue base, it had the edge over Zynga and IGT in this year’s rankings. Its ARPPU numbers are higher and its general ARPU numbers are lower than some of its competitors, which suggests it has a reliance on high- alue players. But its strengths outweigh its weaknesses.
A recent corporate restructuring at its parent company has seen CIE spun out into a new corporate entity called Caesars Growth Partners. With CIE stripped out from the land-based parent, it will be under increasing pressure to drive growth and we expect it to continue to lead from the front. And it is well-placed to capitalise on the launch of real-money gaming in both Nevada and New Jersey.
At a time when Zynga seems to be wobbling slightly, it would be easy to give the top spot to one of its rivals based on that alone. But the panel felt CIE was the rightful owner of the top spot on this year’s list on its own merit, and will continue to be one to watch in the next 12 months.
