# Senior Engineer
*NOTE: All the guidelines listed here are __minimal__ requirements! Completing these, of course, does not automatically make you eligible to be promoted to senior level!*

Programming is an art. Its a fact. Accept it. You cannot become a good artist by completing a checklist. So please take this guide for what it is worth. It just a basic checklist that anyways  should get completed for a amateur programmer trying to get to a professional level. It is by no means an exhaustive list, and a good programmer would obviously end up acquiring orders of magnitude more knowledge than what this guide represents.

Moreover, completing this checklist by quickly running through the content mindlessly, just to finish it off, without absorbing the underlying idea is never going to make a good programmer just like mugging through the course-material for grades does not make someone a better student.

All these warnings are actually pretty obvious. So kindly be true to yourself and lets not try to game the system for promotions or other material benefits. Even if you are stupid enough to belive you can fake it, please dont, because you will get caught by your mentor in no time and it will reflect bad on you. Good hackers can easily tell if someone is faking.
