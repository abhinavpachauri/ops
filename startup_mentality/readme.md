### A Sense of Urgency
The team needs to create value and to deliver it to the market quickly enough in order to stay ahead of the competition

### Risk Aversion
Doing something that has never been done before. Something big and meaningful! Not playing it safe. Willingness to try new things.

### Teamwork
Dropping everything else and getting up to help a teammate asking for help – including over the weekend.

### Willing to take Extreme measures
Over night delivery – we call it nightout:)

### Learning
This is the fun part. In other words, assembling the parachute on the way diving!

### Optimism
It may look and smell like a sausage, but will make it work!

### Volunteering
Pull vs. push system.

### Dictatorship of the Mind
The best idea wins regardless who came up with it. The team will rally around the best idea!

### Commitment to the product, the team, the company
Time estimates are always wrong and underestimate the effort. The last reaction to slipping is to move the date and the first one is to stick to one’s commitment.
